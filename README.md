# mostly-harmless

A collection of random workflows and possibly useful things like guides that I use to maintain our fork of devopsdays-web.

## workflows

### .github/workflows/sync-fork.yml

This does essentially what it says on the tin, it syncs devopsdays-web to this fork. Sadly the permissions on the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` don't allow upstream merges and until I figure out which permission we require, if any, we use a token generated by a bot user tied to our email. The sync currently runs either on workflow dispatch (manual) or at five am every morning as we generally don't work on this _that_ much.
